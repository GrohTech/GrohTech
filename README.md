# Lauren Groh


- 👀  I like to solve problems and I’m interested in finding ways to build the ideas that are in my head.
- 🌱  Currently in a fullstack coding bootcamp (Aug 2021 - Feb 2022)
- &#x1f635;&#x200d;&#x1f4ab;  When I'm not burning the candle at both ends (my current state), I can be found outdoor adventuring with my wife and dogs. Depending on the moment, that might mean camping, hiking, biking, rollerblading, etc. I also enjoy being at home, gardening and building stuff with wood.
