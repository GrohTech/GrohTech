- &#129472;&nbsp; .Midwest.Wisconsin.Milwaukee 
- &#129513;&nbsp; I like to solve problems and Iâ€™m interested in finding ways to build the ideas that are in my head.
- &#128214;&nbsp; Currently in a fullstack coding bootcamp (Aug 2021 - Feb 2022)
- &#9978; &#65039;&nbsp; When I'm not burning the candle at both ends (my current state), I can be found outdoor adventuring with my wife and dogs. Depending on the moment, that might mean camping, hiking, biking, rollerblading, etc. I also enjoy being at home, gardening and building stuff with wood.
