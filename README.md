- 👋 Hi, I’m Lauren Groh!
- 👀 I've been told I'm analytical. I'd agree with that assessment. I like to solve problems and I’m interested in finding ways to build the ideas that are in my head.
- 💞️ I taught myself HTML and CSS using free online resources.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript & I'll be starting a full stack coding bootcamp in August of 2021.
- 📫 Find me on Twitter or CodePen: @GrohTech.
