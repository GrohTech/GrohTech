# Lauren Groh

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lauren Groh!
- ðŸ‘€ I like to solve problems and Iâ€™m interested in finding ways to build the ideas that are in my head.
- ðŸŒ± Currently in a fullstack coding bootcamp (Aug 2021 - Feb 2022)
- &#x1f635;&#x200d;&#x1f4ab; When I'm not burning the candle at both ends (current state), I can be found outdoor adventuring with my wife and dogs. Depending on the moment, that might mean camping, hiking, biking, rollerblading, etc. I also enjoy being at home, gardening and building stuff with wood.
